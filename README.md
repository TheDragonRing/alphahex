Alphahex
========
---------
This is the first website template I have ever made from scratch.

Features:
---------

  **Responsive** â€” The site template is built to be both mobile friendly and desktop friendly, with different layouts that automatically adjust to your screen or windows size.

  **Scripts** - It comes with a contact form that uses a responsive script to send emails using the mailto function, 'scroll to top' button, an automatically updating copyright (you will have to edit the main.js file to change it to your name!) and content that fades in at a comfortable speed when the page loads (JavaScript/jQuery).

  **Blog** - The template has a self-managed blog template included, with posts and an RSS feed that are very easy to use and blend in with the look of the rest of the site.

Downloading & Installing:
-------------------------

  **Downloading** - Go to https://thedragonring.me/projects, find Alphahex and click the download button.

  **Installing** - Extract the downloaded files and move them to your site's root (or wherever you want it to go) and customize the file. Voila, done!

  _Be careful when editing files! Sometimes just one line can break the whole template._
